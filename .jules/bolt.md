## 2024-05-22 - Layout Thrashing in Drag Handlers
**Learning:** Reading layout properties like `offsetLeft` or `offsetTop` inside high-frequency event handlers (like `mousemove` or `touchmove`) forces the browser to synchronously calculate layout (reflow), which can cause significant performance degradation, especially on mobile devices.
**Action:** When calculating deltas for drag interactions, use absolute coordinates (like `pageX`/`pageY`) instead of relative coordinates that require DOM reads. The math `(current - offset) - (start - offset)` simplifies to `current - start`, eliminating the need for the offset entirely.
