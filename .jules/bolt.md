**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` trigger expensive re-renders when using `useState`. Using `framer-motion`'s `useMotionValue` and `useTransform` allows updating animations completely outside the React render loop.
**Action:** For interactive animations dependent on pointer events, prefer `useMotionValue` over React state and decompose complex components so only affected children update via `useMotionValueEvent` or direct binding.
